## Installations
To be able to run the notebook the user will need a conda environment with geopandas and shapely packages installed. The user can refer to the spec.txt file if they want to re-create the environment from scratch.

## Project Motivation
It is common knowledge that jobs in the STEM fields in the US are increasing every year, and to meet this demand employers are increasingly looking to hire talent from outside the country. Employers who choose to sponsor visas need to apply for LCA (Labor Condition Application) and H-1B visa for each of their alien employees. This data set contains those applications recieved by US Immigration department (https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa). Our goal is to glean insights for "data science" and "data related" jobs from this data set. An international candidate who is looking to enter into the data science field in the US might be interested in finding out if there is a growth in applications for relevant data jobs over the years. They might also be intersted in knowing where these jobs are located and the salaries one can expect. We will be attempting to answer these questions in this exploration.
